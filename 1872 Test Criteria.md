Upon receipt of the gun (by the Board) let the inventor:

3. Distribute parts to members for examination.
4. Then *when upon request* assemble it.
5. Show general mechanical movements and advantages claimed.
6. Leave the gun for the board.

And also the following general tests for the arms presented for examination:

1) Examine the mechanical construction, facility and rapidity of dismounting and re-assembling.
2) Facility of loading and extracting shells.
3) Effect of dust in impeding the mechanism.
4) Effect of water and consequent rust on mechanism.

5) Rapidity of fire, at will and from the shoulder.
6) Accuracy of fire, at will and from the shoulder.
7) Effect of dust and rust upon rapidity and accuracy.
8) Effect of defective ammunition.
9) Effect of overcharges and firing with dirty bore.

Also such other tests by firing and exposure as the Board my desire to apply.
