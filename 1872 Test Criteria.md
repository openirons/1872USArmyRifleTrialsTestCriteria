# Preliminary Review of Each Gun Submitted for Examination

A form will be filled out by persons presenting sample guns for examination by the Board.

Upon receipt of the gun [by the Board] let the inventor:
1. Explain it.
2. Take it apart.
3. Distribute parts to members for examination.
4. Then *when upon request* assemble it.
5. Show general mechanical movements and advantages claimed.
6. Leave the gun for the board.

And also the following general tests for the arms presented for examination:

BEFORE FIRING

1) Examine the mechanical construction, facility and rapidity of dismounting and re-assembling.
2) Facility of loading and extracting shells.
3) Effect of dust in impeding the mechanism.
4) Effect of water and consequent rust on mechanism.

AFTER THE ABOVE

5) Rapidity of fire, at will and from the shoulder.
6) Accuracy of fire, at will and from the shoulder.
7) Effect of dust and rust upon rapidity and accuracy.
8) Effect of defective ammunition.
9) Effect of overcharges and firing with dirty bore.
10) Number of Parts, simplicity in assembling, and liability of detached parts to loss and breakage.

Also such other tests by firing and exposure as the Board my desire to apply.

# Tests for a Gun Which the Board Have Decided To Subject to Trial

## Rules
* The piece to be first fired ten rounds by the exhibitor, or with a lanyard, as a test of safety.
* The firing to be then continued according to the rules annexed, by an employee of the Armory, or solider detailed by the War Department. The record to be based upon this firing, though exhibitors may have the privilege of displaying the powers of their guns if desired, and of having their performance noted in the record.
* The service-cartridge to be used in all cases where the gun is chambered for it, except in the special trials made by exhibiors.
* No person will be admitted to the firing ground but the agents or exhibitors of the gun immediately under trial, and such other persons as may be specifically invited by the Board.

## Tests
1. *Rapidity with aim* - The number of shots which, fired in one minute, strike a target 6 feet by 2 feet at a distance of 100 feet. Any cartridges missing fire [misfires] in this or other tests to be tried with a prick-punch, or opened to ascertain the cause of failure. The test to be begun with an empty chamber or magazine, the cartridges to be disposed at will on a table.
2. *Rapidity at will* - The number of shots that can be fired in one minute, irrespective of aim.
3. *Endurance* - Each gun to be fired 500 continuous rounds, without cleaning. The state of the breech-mechanism to be examined at the end of every 50-rounds.
4. *Defective cartridges* - Each gun to be fired once with each of the following defective cartridges:
   1. Cross-filed on head to nearly the thickness of the metal.
   2. Cut at intervals around the rim.
   3. With a longitudinal cut the whole length of the cartridge from the rim up. A fresh piece of white paper marked with the number of the gun being laid over the breech to observe the escape of gas, if any occurs.
5. *Dust* - The piece to be exposed in a box prepared for that purpose to blast of find sand-dust for __ minutes; to be removed, fired 50 rounds, replaced for 5 minutes, removed and fired 50 rounds more.
6. *Rust* - The breech mechanism and receiver to be cleansed of grease and the chamber of the barrel greased and plugged, the butt of the gun to be inserted into the height of the chamber in brine for 10 minutes, exposed for two days to the open air standing in a rack, and then fired 50 rounds.
7. *Excessive charges* - To be fired once with 85 grains of powder and one ball of 450 grains of lead; once with 90 grains and one ball; and once with 90 grains and two balls. The piece to be closely examined after each discharge.
