# 1872 U.S. Army Rifle Trials Test Criteria
## Description
This repository documents the changes to the test criteria used by the U.S. Army Service Rifle Trials of 1872 (the "Trials").

## Background
In June of 1872, Congress passed an appropriations bill that authorized $150,000 for the manufacture of new arms only if the Army could select a standard breech-loading system for muskets and carbines.
The "Board for Selecting a Breech-System for Muskets and Carbines" (the "Board") was assembled on September 3rd, 1872. After exhaustive testing of weapons and reviewing field trials reports authorized in the Rifle Trials of 1870, the Board submitted their final report and recommendation to the Secretary of War on May 5th, 1873.

## Objectives of This Project
1) Clearly document the test criteria established by the Board.
2) Document the evolution of the test criteria during the Trials.

## How to Use This Material
The document detailing the tests used in the Trials is in Markdown format, readable by any text editor, and well-suited to viewing here in the github repository.
